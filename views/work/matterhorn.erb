I have been involved in designing & building Matterhorn over the past year. Matterhorn has had multiple iterations based on internal and external user testing and feedback. I studied user behaviours and preferences to define and refine the core features and functionalities of the product. I have also been involved in the planning around itâ€™s recent launch including marketing strategy, copywriting and designing the landing page.
