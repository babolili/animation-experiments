       For the discretion of the client, we won't tell you much about our work with Tottenham Hotspurs. We can tell you that over several weeks, we were involved in helping Tottenham Hotspurs modernise and refine their mobile, tablet and desktop e-commerce experience. This involved UX auditing and design, as well as development from within their existing CMS.
