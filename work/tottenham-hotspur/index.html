       For the discretion of the client, we won't tell you much about our work with Tottenham Hotspurs. We can tell you that over several weeks, we were involved in helping Tottenham Hotspurs modernise and refine their mobile, tablet and desktop e-commerce experience. This involved UX auditing and design, as well as development from within their existing CMS.

       I did a full Site and Competitor/Peer review for Tottenham Hotspurs online shop, focusing mainly on their tablet and mobile portals. This involved mapping out potential weaknesses in the purchasing flow, in particular highlighting design and visual hierarchy problems that could deter or prevent a user from making a purchase. I then worked with the Tottenham Hotspur digital team to address the identified issues with mainly CSS changes, and some restructuring of content. This involved a near complete redesign of their mobile portal.
