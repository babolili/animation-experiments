        The Brief
      </h5>
      <p>
        Ubiquity Press is an open access publisher of peer-reviewed academic journals, books and data. It also serves as a platform for academic societies and journals to collect and publish journal articles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ubiquity have the underlying backend and processes to launch their presses, but want a modern design that is in line with the innovative nature of their publishing model.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>
          The brief is to create a HTML/SCSS template journal layout and design that can be customised to some extent by the participating journals.
        </h3>

            Problem:
          </h3>
          <p>
            The visual feel of the Ubiquity Journals pages needed to be in line with the design for the Ubiquity portal presses, while at the same time establish a distinctive look to set it apart and allow journals to customise their look.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            Solution:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Carry over parts of the styling where appropriate, and focus on tailoring the layout to the journal’s purpose, which is different from the presses.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I carried over the typographical style that had been used for the Ubiquity portal presses. The typography suited the purpose and helped establish the connection between the two platforms.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>
          I also used a similar general layout by designing a similar navigation and brand header setup as on the portal presses.
        </h3>
      </blockquote>
      {% image work/up-journals/portal-header.png %}
      {% image work/up-journals/journal-header.png %}
      <p>
        Since journals had previously been able to add a background image to their site, I reconfigured the setup of the headers so that it was easy to add a background image(with variable opacity) to the header element.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>
          We wanted the journal to really look and feel like a modern online magazine, and drew layout inspiration from sites like <a href="http://99u.com/" target="_blank">99U</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank">Buzzfeed</a>.

         The two column split with “latest/trending articles“ on the left was a familiar pattern and fit very well within what the journal was trying to achieve.

          This was an especially interesting problem because ubiquity were interested in offering a “dyslexia friendly” option for their readers.

      <p>
        This worked by toggling the class “dyslexia-mode” on the article container. The styling adheres to the Dritish Dyslexia Association's <a href="http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/common/ckeditor/filemanager/userfiles/About_Us/policies/Dyslexia_Style_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">official style guide</a>
